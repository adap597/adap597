- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adap597
- This year I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I've continued learning through taking Udacity courses and earning a few nanodegrees through that program
- The projects in this respository are all projects I worked on through Thomas Edison State University and Udacity
- I enjoyed web developement the most during my studies and I want to continue to learn more and work on some projects of my own outside of academics
